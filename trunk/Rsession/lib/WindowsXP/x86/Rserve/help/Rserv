_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Starts Rserve in daemon mode (unix only). Any additional
     parameters not related to Rserve will be passed straight to the
     underlying R. For configuration, usage and command line parameters
     please consult the online documentation at
     http://www.rosuda.org/Rserve. Use 'R CMD Rserve --help' for a
     brief help.

     The 'Rserve' function is provided for convenience only, it is
     recommended to start Rserve directly from the command line, not
     from R itself. Also note that the debug version of Rserve doesn't
     fork and thus will block until closed.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     # R CMD Rserve [<parameters>]

     Rserve(debug = FALSE, port = 6311, args = NULL)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   debug: determines whether regular Rserve or debug version of Rserve
          ('Rserve.dbg') should be started.

    port: port used by Rserve to listen for connections

    args: further arguments passed to Rserve (as a string that will be
          passed to the 'system' command thus use quotes where
          necessary).

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Rserve is not just a package, but an application. It is provided
     as a R package for convenience only. For details see
     http://www.rosuda.org/Rserve
